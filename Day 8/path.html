    <div id="about">
        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Veganism is more than just a diet; it’s a lifestyle and philosophy that seeks to avoid the use of animal products in food, clothing, and other areas of life. Rooted in compassion, sustainability, and health, veganism has grown from a niche movement into a mainstream choice for millions of people around the world.</p>

        <h2>What is Veganism?</h2>
        <p>At its core, veganism is the practice of abstaining from animal products. This means no meat, dairy, eggs, or other animal-derived       ingredients. It’s a commitment to living in a way that reduces harm to animals and minimizes the environmental impact caused by     industries that rely on animal agriculture.</p>

        <p>Veganism isn’t limited to what’s on your plate. Many vegans also choose cruelty-free products, avoiding leather, wool, and other         materials derived from animals.</p>

        <h2>The History of Veganism</h2>
        <p>The roots of veganism can be traced back to ancient cultures, many of which embraced plant-based diets for health, ethical, or       spiritual reasons. However, the modern concept of veganism took shape in 1944, when Donald Watson, along with a group of like-minded    individuals, founded the Vegan Society in the United Kingdom. Watson coined the term "vegan," derived from the beginning and end of the   word "vegetarian," to describe someone who avoids all animal-derived products.</p>

        <p>Since then, veganism has gained momentum, particularly in recent decades, due to growing awareness about animal rights,      environmental sustainability, and the health benefits associated with plant-based eating.</p>

        <h2>Why Choose Veganism?</h2>
        <p>Animal Welfare One of the primary reasons people choose veganism is to protect animals. Modern farming practices often involve       cruelty and exploitation of animals, and choosing a vegan lifestyle is one way to take a stand against animal suffering.</p>

        <p>Health Benefits A well-balanced vegan diet can provide numerous health benefits. Studies show that vegan diets are associated with       lower risks of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Vegan diets are also typically lower in       calories and saturated fats, making it easier to maintain a healthy weight.</p>

        <h2>The Future of Veganism</h2>
        <p>As more people embrace veganism for its numerous benefits, the future looks bright. Advances in plant-based food innovation are      making it easier than ever to enjoy delicious, satisfying meals without animal products. Whether you’re vegan for the animals, your     health, or the planet, the movement continues to grow and inspire change.</p>

        <p>By choosing to adopt a plant-based lifestyle, you can make a lasting difference—not only in your own life but also in the lives of       countless animals, the planet, and future generations.</p>
